## Community Mobility Report by Google - Data Block

The Google Community Mobility Reports data block for Looker compares communities' mobility (as measured via anonymized cell phone location data) visiting different types of locations. Data is compared to baseline values computed as the median in the 5‑week period Jan 3 – Feb 6, 2020 by day of the week. Data is updated regularly, but not daily. For more information, we strongly encourage you to read [the full documentation](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/).
